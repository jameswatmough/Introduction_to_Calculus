# Limits and Continuity {#sec-continuity}

## Discontinuities 

Discontinuity (according to Google)
: a sharp difference of characteristics between parts of something

Discontinuities are all around us: the edges of sidewalks, potholes in the road, sudden losses of power.  To model discontinuities, we need functions with discontinuities.  There are several types of discontinuities that appear in functions.  Three of the most common are *jumps*, *vertical asymptotes* and *holes*.  In a jump discontinuity, the left and right parts of a function are smooth, but the two parts don't meet (see @fig-discon-jump).  These are useful to model switches, boundaries, or sudden shifts in outputs.  A vertical asymptote where a function *goes to infinity* for some inputs (see @fig-discon-pole).  A third type of discontinuity we'll call a hole occurs when the two sides of a function are smooth and line up, but the function either isn't defined or is completely out of line in the middle (see @fig-discon-hole).

Three Common Discontinuities

:::

The common characteristic of a discontinuity in a function is that the outputs of the function for points in the domain near the discontinuity are not close together.  For example, if a function has a jump discontinuity at some point, $a$, then the outputs of the function for inputs near $a$ are split into two separate intervals (see @fig-discon-jump-interval)

## Continuous Functions

Functions with discontinuities are useful modelling tools, but they can also be difficult to analyze.  It is important to know where functions are continuous and how they behave near discontinuities.  We will learn to characterize discontinuities using limits, but first let's clarify our notion of continuity of functions.

Our goal is to make the following statement precise.

> A continuous function is one with no holes, jumps or seriously wiggly bits.

Other common intuitive definitions of continuity, are 

> a function $f$ is continuous at a point $a$ if $f(x)$ is close to $f(a)$ whenever $x$ is close to $a$,
> a function $f$ is continuous if it can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper.

To make this notion precise, it helps to (re)introduce some terminology.

::: {#def-neighbourhood}

# Neighbourhood of a point

For our purposes, a *neighbourhood* of $a$ is any open interval containing $a$.  This will typically be the set of all points within some distance, say $\delta$, of $a$.  That is, the interval $\set{x}{|x-a|<\delta}$.

More generally, given a point $a$ and a set $X$ we say a subset $U$ of $X$ is a *neighbourhood* of $a$ in $X$ if $U$ contains all the points of $X$ in some open interval containing $a$.  

:::

::: {#def-images}

# Image of a set 

Given a function $f$ and a  subset $U$ of the domain of $f$, the *image* of $U$ under $f$  is the set of all outputs reached by inputs in $U$.  This image is often denoted simply by $f(U)$. That is, $$f(U) = \set{f(x)}{x\in U}.$$    The *preimage* or *inverse image* of a subset $V$ of the codomain of $f$, denoted by $f^{-1}(V)$, is the set of all inputs whose corresponding outputs are in $V$.  That is, $$f^{-1}(V) = \set{x}{\text{$y=f(x)$ for some $y \in V$}}.$$

:::

::: {#def-continuous-function}

# Continuous functions

A function $f$ is continuous at a point $c$ in its domain if every neighbourhood of $f(a)$ contains the image of some neighbourhood of $a$ in the domain of $f$.

A function $f$ is continuous on its domain, or simply, continuous, if it is continuous at every point in its domain.

:::

We say $f$ has a *discontinuity* at a point, or $f$ is discontinuous at a point, if $f$ isn't continuous at that point.

::: {#exm-discon-1}

Consider the (piecewise) function $f$ defined by
$$f(x) = \begin{cases}
x+1 & -1 \le x < 0 \\
x^2 & 0 \le x \le 1
\end{cases}$$

Does $f$ have a discontinuity at $0$?

:::

To test this with our definition of neighbourhoods and continuity, we'll let $\delta$ be a small positive number and evaluate $f(x)$ for $-\delta < x < \delta$.  This interval is our *neighbourhood* of 0.

We need to evaluate $f$ separately for the two pieces.

+ If $-\delta < x < 0$, then $1-\delta < x+1 < 1$, so $1-\delta < f(x) < 1$.
+ If $0 < x < \delta$, then $0 < x^2 < \delta^2$, so $0 < f(x) < \delta^2$.
+ If $x=0$, $f(x) = 0$

So the right half of our neighbourhood of 0 is near $f(0)$, but if $\delta < 1$, then the left half is not *near* $f(0)$, it's near 1.  We have a jump discontinuity.

Notice how this example reverses the logic of our definition of continuity.  The definition states that every neighbourhood of $f(a)$ contains an image of *some* neighbourhood of $a$.  Thus to show a function is continuous we first specify an arbitrary tolerance for how close the function should be to $f(a)$ and then check how close points must be to $a$ to ensure they land close to $f(a)$.   Since our function $f$ in this example splits neighbourhoods of 0 into two pieces, one near 0 and one near 1, it can't satisfy the requirements of the definition of continuity at $a$.

::: {#exm-discon-2}

Consider the (piecewise) function $f$ defined by
$$f(x) = \begin{cases}
x+1 & -1 \le x < 0 \\
1-x^2 & 0 \le x \le 1
\end{cases}$$

Does $f$ have a discontinuity at $0$?

:::

Since the left side of the function has the same definition, we just need to look at what $f$ does to the right half of a neighbourhood of $0$.

+ If $0 < x < \delta$, then $1 < 1-x^2 < 1-\delta^2$, so $1 < f(x) < 1-\delta^2$.

For this example, $f(0) = 1$ and the image of a neighbourhood of 0 stays in a neighbourhood of $f(0)$.  Hence $f$ is continuous at 0.

# Properties of Continuous Functions

::: {#def-bounded}
# Bounded Functions

We say a function $f$ is 

a. *bounded above* if there is a number $M$ for which $f(x) \le M$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$; 
b. *bounded below* if there is a number $L$ for which $f(x) \ge L$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$; 
c. *bounded* if $f$ is both bounded above and bounded below.

We refer to the numbers $M$ and $L$ as upper and lower *bounds* for $f$.

:::

::: {#def-extreme-values}
# Extreme Values

If $M$ is an upper bound for $f$ and $f(x) = M$ at some point $x$, then we refer to $M$ as the *maximum value* of $f$.   Similarly, if $L$ is an lower bound for $f$ and $f(x) = L$ at some point $x$, then we refer to $L$ as the *minimum value* of $f$.

:::

::: {#thm-evt}

# The Extreme Value Theorem

If $f$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$, then $f$ is bounded.  Further $f$ attains its maximum and minimum values.  

:::

::: {#thm-ivt}

# The Intermediate Value Theorem

If $f$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$, and $L$ is any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there is at least one point $c$ between $a$ and $b$ for which $f(c) = L$.
