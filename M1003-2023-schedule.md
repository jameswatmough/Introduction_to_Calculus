During the term we will work our way through the first 4 chapters the two texts:

- [Apex Calculus](https://opentext.uleth.ca/apex-calculus/apex-calculus.html)
- [Openstax Calculus Volume I](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1)

In the table below, 
the numbers in the columns **Apex** and **Stax** refer to sections in the two texts.
Links in the **Section** column should take you to relevant sections in James Watmough's lecture notes.
Note this schedule is **tentative** and will see minor updates throughout the term.
