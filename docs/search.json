    "section": "1.1 Functions and variables",
    "text": "1.1 Functions and variables\nThese notes are purposefully abstract. We’ll begin with a list of definitions of familiar terms cast as something more abstract than you might be used to. Almost all of the functions we use will be real-valued functions of a single real variable. That is, both the domains and ranges will be sets of real numbers. However, most of the concepts on the first-year curriculum apply to a more abstract notion of a function. In fact, some might be easier to understand when the domain is a region in the plane, rather than an interval.\nFunctions arise whenever one quantity (or state) can be determined from another. Functions also arise whenever we theorize that one quantity (or state) could be determined from another.\nExamples:\n\nReducing screen brightness increases Battery life.\nThe temperature of tap water depends on the time since the tap was opened.\nThe area of a circle depends on its radius.\nThe rate a predator encounters prey depends on the size of the prey population.\n\nThe quantity being determined is often referred to as the dependent variable, and the other quantify is the independent variable.\n\nDefinition 1.1 (Function) A function consists of two sets, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), together with a rule that assigns exactly one element of \\(B\\) to each and every element of \\(A\\).\n\nIt is common to think of the elements of \\(A\\) as inputs and the elements of \\(B\\) as outputs. The function matches each input to exactly one output.\n\nIdeally a function should be given a clear descriptive name, but it is often denoted by a single letter, like \\(f\\).\nThe set \\(A\\) in Definition 1.1 is referred to as the domain of \\(f\\).\nThe set \\(B\\) is referred to as the codomain of \\(f\\).\nWe say \\(f\\) is a function from \\(A\\) into \\(B\\), and sometimes write \\(f:A\\rightarrow B\\).\n\nWe use \\(f(x)\\) to denote the element of \\(B\\) assigned to an element \\(x\\) of \\(A\\) by \\(f\\).\nThe range of \\(f\\) is the set \\(\\left\\{y\\in B \\ \\left|\\ \\strut y=f(x), x\\in A\\right.\\right\\}\\).\n\nWhen we are using variables and functions to explain concepts it is a good idea to name the variables and functions in meaningful ways. For example, suppose we need a function to model the rate a lioness searches for prey. When the number of prey is low, she will chase down every prey she sees, but when there are lots of prey available, she will only chase down enough to satisfy her hunger. A simple model for this saturation effect is a hyperbola. We could use a descriptive name like \\(\\texttt{Prey}\\) to denote the number of prey, our independent variable. \\(\\texttt{Prey}\\) should be a positive real number. Then we could give our function a descriptive name like \\(\\texttt{Lioness\\_Attack}\\) and define it by the rule \\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\texttt{Lioness\\_Attack}(\\texttt{Prey}) = \\frac{\\texttt{attack\\_rate}\\times\\texttt{Prey} }{ \\texttt{saturation\\_level} + \\texttt{Prey} }, \\qquad \\texttt{Prey} \\ge 0.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWe will refer to attack\\_rate and saturation\\_level as parameters, Prey as the independent variable, and Lioness\\_Attack as the function. The use and meaning of the word parameter may be different outside of these notes, but it usually indicates a fixed quantity. I.e., something that isn’t varying.\nWhile descriptive variable and function names are helpful at times, they can be annoying at times. Especially if we are trying to solve equations algebraically. So in this course, and most math courses, variable and function names will usually be single letters.\nAnother common way to specify a function is using a arrow with the input on one side and the output on the other. For example \\[x\\to x^2 + 2, x \\in {\\mathbb R}\\] defines a function whose input is any real number and whose output is two plus the square of the input. Notice how this lets us define a function without the complication of naming it. In many programming languages this is referred to as an anonymous function.\n\nExample 1.1 (Function Notation) Let \\(P\\) be the function defined by \\[x \\to 3x^2 - x + 5, \\quad x\\in {\\mathbb R}.\\] Think of \\(P\\) as the name of the function, and \\(P(x)\\) as the value of the function at \\(x\\).\n\nthe value of \\(P\\) at 2 is \\[P(2) = 3(2)^2 - (2) + 5 = 12 - 2 + 5 = 15\\]\ngiven a number, \\(t\\), the value of \\(P\\) at \\(t+1\\) is \\[P(t+1) = 3 (t+1)^2 - (t+1) + 5\\]\ngiven a number, \\(x\\), the value of \\(P\\) at \\(x^2\\) is \\[P(x^2) = 3 (x^2)^2 - (x^2) + 5\\]\n\n\nThis notation lets us define new functions using previously named functions. For example, \\(g\\) can be defined by the rule \\(g(x) = P(x^2)\\).\n\nDefinition 1.2 Given a function, \\(f\\), the image of a subset \\(U\\) of the domain of \\(f\\), denoted simply by \\(f(U)\\), is the set of all outputs reached by inputs in \\(U\\). That is, \\[f(U) = \\left\\{y\\in B  \\ \\left|\\ \\strut  y=f(x), x\\in U\\right.\\right\\}.\\] The preimage or inverse image of a subset \\(V\\) of the codomain of \\(f\\), denoted by \\(f^{-1}(V)\\), is the set of all inputs whose corresponding outputs are in \\(V\\). That is, \\[f^{-1}(V) = \\left\\{x\\in A \\ \\left|\\ \\strut \\text{$y=f(x)$ for some $y \\in V$}\\right.\\right\\}.\\]"

The trick is picking the best points. Since we know the cosine is zero when its input is a multiple of \\(\\pi\\), we pick values for \\(x\\) for which \\(2x-3\\), the input to the cosine, is \\(\\pi\\). That is, solve \\(2x-3 = \\pi\\) for \\(x\\). We find \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}(3+\\pi)\\). Of course this is only one multiple of \\(\\pi\\). We said any multiple, so replace \\(\\pi\\) by \\(n\\pi\\) and let \\(n\\) be any integer. Similarly, we know the cosine is 1 if its input is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) plus any multiple of \\(\\pi\\). Let’s put this all in a table for easy reference. We’ll call the input to the cosine the angle \\(\\theta\\), pick values for \\(\\theta\\), and then compute \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}(3+\\theta)\\) and \\(y = 2 + 3\\cos \\theta\\).\n\n\n\n\\(\\theta\\)\n\\(\\cos \\theta\\)\n\\(x\\)\n\\(y\\)\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n\\(\\frac{3}{2}\\)\n5\n\n\n\\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\)\n0\n\\(\\frac{3}{2}+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\)\n2\n\n\n\\(\\pi\\)\n-1\n\\(\\frac{3}{2}+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\)\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(y = -2\\tan\\big(\\pi(x-2)\\big)\\)\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Simplifying Trig Functions\n\n\\(\\sec x \\sin x \\cot x\\)\n\\(\\sec x - \\cos x\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{1 + \\tan^2 \\alpha}{1 + \\cot^2\\alpha}\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{\\sin x} {\\cos x + 1} + \\dfrac{\\cos x - 1}{\\sin x}\\)\n\nThe last one is prob 150 in open stax.

    "text": "2.6 Inverse Trigonometric Functions\nThe trigonometric functions and their inverses arise in a wide variety of problems involving triangles, lengths of curves and areas of surfaces. Typical problems lead to triangles where the length of one of the sides is variable and one of the sides is fixed.\nA variety of notations are used for the inverse trig functions. The inverse of the sine function is denoted by \\(\\sin^{-1}\\) or \\(\\arcsin\\). In computer languages, the short form asin is often used. Similar notations are used for the other standard trig functions.\n\nExample 2.1 Suppose one end of a beam of unit length is lifted a height \\(x\\) off the ground.\n\nFind the horizontal distance between the ends of the beam.\n\nFind the angle the beam makes with the ground.\n\nLabel the vertical of a right triangle as the dependent variable \\(x\\) and the hypotenuse with the fixed unit length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[x = \\sin(y)\\] \\[\\sqrt{1-x^2} = \\cos(y)\\] \\[\\tan y = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\]\nThe horizontal distance between the ends of the beam is \\(\\sqrt{1-x^2}\\), based on Pythagoras’ theorem. The angle \\(y\\) is denoted by the inverse function \\(\\sin^{-1}(x)\\). At this point we do not have an algorithm or rule for computing the inverse sine function, other than by use of a ruler and protractor. We will learn methods for estimating values of this function towards the end of this course.\n\n\nExample 2.2 Suppose a boat is being pulled towards a dock. Find the horizontal distance between the boat and the dock, the length of the rope played out and the angle the rope makes with the horizontal.\nThe rope is the hypotenuse of a triangle, and its length is variable. We can assume the height of the rope at the dock is 1 unit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[x = \\csc(y)\\] \\[\\sqrt{x^2-1} = \\cot(y)\\]\n\n\nExample 2.3 A third common scenario involves a balloon rising vertically. Here the base of the triangle is the fixed length and the vertical is variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[x = \\tan(y)\\] \\[\\sqrt{1+x^2} = \\sec(y)\\]\n\n\nExercise 2.2 Use the above relations to verify the following strange identities.\n\\[x = \\sin(\\cos^{-1}(\\sqrt{1-x^2})\\] \\[x = \\cot(\\csc^{-1}(\\sqrt{x^2-1})\\] \\[x = \\tan(\\sec^{-1}(\\sqrt{1+x^2})\\]\nCare must be taken in choosing the domain and range of the trig functions and their inverses. These are always problem dependent. Common choices for sine and cosine are shown in the graphs below."
