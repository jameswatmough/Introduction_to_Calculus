    "text": "1.1 Functions and variables\nThese notes are purposefully abstract. We’ll begin with a list of definitions of familiar terms cast as something more abstract than you might be used to. Almost all of the functions we use will be real-valued functions of a single real variable. That is, both the domains and ranges will be sets of real numbers. However, most of the concepts on the first-year curriculum apply to a more abstract notion of a function. In fact, some might be easier to understand when the domain is a region in the plane, rather than an interval.\nFunctions arise whenever one quantity (or state) can be determined from another. Functions also arise whenever we theorize that one quantity (or state) could be determined from another.\nExamples:\nThe quantity being determined is often referred to as the dependent variable, and the other quantify is the independent variable.\nIt is common to think of the elements of \\(A\\) as inputs and the elements of \\(B\\) as outputs. The function matches each input to exactly one output.\nWhen we are using variables and functions to explain concepts it is a good idea to name the variables and functions in meaningful ways. For example, suppose we need a function to model the rate a lioness searches for prey. When the number of prey is low, she will chase down every prey she sees, but when there are lots of prey available, she will only chase down enough to satisfy her hunger. A simple model for this saturation effect is a hyperbola. We could use a descriptive name like \\(\\texttt{Prey}\\) to denote the number of prey, our independent variable. \\(\\texttt{Prey}\\) should be a positive real number. Then we could give our function a descriptive name like \\(\\texttt{Lioness\\_Attack}\\) and define it by the rule \\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\texttt{Lioness\\_Attack}(\\texttt{Prey}) = \\frac{\\texttt{attack\\_rate}\\times\\texttt{Prey} }{ \\texttt{saturation\\_level} + \\texttt{Prey} }, \\qquad \\texttt{Prey} \\ge 0.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWe will refer to attack\\_rate and saturation\\_level as parameters, Prey as the independent variable, and Lioness\\_Attack as the function. The use and meaning of the word parameter may be different outside of these notes, but it usually indicates a fixed quantity. I.e., something that isn’t varying.\nWhile descriptive variable and function names are helpful at times, they can be annoying at times. Especially if we are trying to solve equations algebraically. So in this course, and most math courses, variable and function names will usually be single letters.\nAnother common way to specify a function is using a arrow with the input on one side and the output on the other. For example \\[x\\to x^2 + 2, x \\in {\\mathbb R}\\] defines a function whose input is any real number and whose output is two plus the square of the input. Notice how this lets us define a function without the complication of naming it. In many programming languages this is referred to as an anonymous function.\nThis notation lets us define new functions using previously named functions. For example, \\(g\\) can be defined by the rule \\(g(x) = P(x^2)\\).",

    "text": "2.6 Inverse Trigonometric Functions\nThe trigonometric functions and their inverses arise in a wide variety of problems involving triangles, lengths of curves and areas of surfaces. Typical problems lead to triangles where the length of one of the sides is variable and one of the sides is fixed.\nA variety of notations are used for the inverse trig functions. The inverse of the sine function is denoted by \\(\\sin^{-1}\\) or \\(\\arcsin\\). In computer languages, the short form asin is often used. Similar notations are used for the other standard trig functions.\n\nExample 2.1 Suppose one end of a beam of unit length is lifted a height \\(x\\) off the ground.\n\nFind the horizontal distance between the ends of the beam.\n\nFind the angle the beam makes with the ground.\n\nLabel the vertical of a right triangle as the dependent variable \\(x\\) and the hypotenuse with the fixed unit length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[x = \\sin(y)\\] \\[\\sqrt{1-x^2} = \\cos(y)\\] \\[\\tan y = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\]\nThe horizontal distance between the ends of the beam is \\(\\sqrt{1-x^2}\\), based on Pythagoras’ theorem. The angle \\(y\\) is denoted by the inverse function \\(\\sin^{-1}(x)\\). At this point we do not have an algorithm or rule for computing the inverse sine function, other than by use of a ruler and protractor. We will learn methods for estimating values of this function towards the end of this course.\n\n\nExample 2.2 Suppose a boat is being pulled towards a dock. Find the horizontal distance between the boat and the dock, the length of the rope played out and the angle the rope makes with the horizontal.\nThe rope is the hypotenuse of a triangle, and its length is variable.

    "text": "3.1 Discontinuities\nDiscontinuities are all around us: the edges of sidewalks, potholes in the road, sudden losses of power. To model discontinuities, we need functions with discontinuities. There are several types of discontinuities that appear in functions. Three of the most common are jumps, vertical asymptotes and holes. In a jump discontinuity, the left and right parts of a function are smooth, but the two parts don’t meet (see Figure 3.1 (a)). These are useful to model switches, boundaries, or sudden shifts in outputs. A vertical asymptote where a function goes to infinity for some inputs (see Figure 3.1 (b)). A third type of discontinuity we’ll call a hole occurs when the two sides of a function are smooth and line up, but the function either isn’t defined or is completely out of line in the middle (see Figure 3.1 (c)).\nThe common characteristic of a discontinuity in a function is that the outputs of the function for points in the domain near the discontinuity, are not close together. For example, if a function has a jump discontinuity at some point, \\(a\\), then the outputs of the function for inputs near \\(a\\) are split into two separate intervals (see ?fig-discon-jump-interval)",

    "text": "3.2 Continuous Functions\nFunctions with discontinuities are useful modelling tools, but they can also be difficult to analyze. It is important to know where functions are continuous and how they behave near discontinuities. We will learn to characterize discontinuities using limits, but first let’s clarify our notion of continuity of functions.\nOur goal is to make the following statement precise.\n\nA continuous function is one with no holes, jumps or seriously wiggly bits.\n\nOther common intuitive definitions of continuity, are\n\na function \\(f\\) is continuous at a point \\(a\\) if \\(f(x)\\) is close to \\(f(a)\\) whenever \\(x\\) is close to \\(a\\), a function \\(f\\) is continuous if it can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper.\n\nTo make this notion precise, it helps to (re)introduce some terminology.\n\nDefinition 3.1 (Neighbourhood of a point) For our purposes, a neighbourhood of \\(a\\) is any open interval containing \\(a\\). This will typically be the set of all points within some distance, say \\(\\delta\\), of \\(a\\). That is, the interval \\(\\left\\{x \\ \\left|\\ \\strut |x-a|&lt;\\delta\\right.\\right\\}\\).\nMore generally, given a point \\(a\\) and a set \\(X\\) we say a subset \\(U\\) of \\(X\\) is a neighbourhood of \\(a\\) in \\(X\\) if \\(U\\) contains all the points of \\(X\\) in some open interval containing \\(a\\).\n\n\nDefinition 3.2 (Image of a set) Given a function \\(f\\) and a subset \\(U\\) of the domain of \\(f\\), the image of \\(U\\) under \\(f\\) is the set of all outputs reached by inputs in \\(U\\). This image is often denoted simply by \\(f(U)\\). That is, \\[f(U) = \\left\\{f(x) \\ \\left|\\ \\strut x\\in U\\right.\\right\\}.\\] The preimage or inverse image of a subset \\(V\\) of the codomain of \\(f\\), denoted by \\(f^{-1}(V)\\), is the set of all inputs whose corresponding outputs are in \\(V\\). That is, \\[f^{-1}(V) = \\left\\{x \\ \\left|\\ \\strut \\text{$y=f(x)$ for some $y \\in V$}\\right.\\right\\}.\\]\n\n\nDefinition 3.3 (Continuous functions) A function \\(f\\) is continuous at a point \\(c\\) in its domain if every neighbourhood of \\(f(a)\\) contains the image of some neighbourhood of \\(a\\) in the domain of \\(f\\).\nA function \\(f\\) is continuous on its domain, or simply, continuous, if it is continuous at every point in its domain.\n\nWe say \\(f\\) has a discontinuity at a point, or \\(f\\) is discontinuous at a point, if \\(f\\) isn’t continuous at that point.\n\nExample 3.1 Consider the (piecewise) function \\(f\\) defined by \\[f(x) = \\begin{cases}\nx+1 & -1 \\le x &lt; 0 \\\\\nx^2 & 0 \\le x \\le 1\n\\end{cases}\\]\nDoes \\(f\\) have a discontinuity at \\(0\\)?\n\nTo test this with our definition of neighbourhoods and continuity, we’ll let \\(\\delta\\) be a small positive number and evaluate \\(f(x)\\) for \\(-\\delta &lt; x &lt; \\delta\\). This interval is our neighbourhood of 0.\nWe need to evaluate \\(f\\) in separately for the two pieces.\n\nIf \\(-\\delta &lt; x &lt; 0\\), then \\(1-\\delta &lt; x+1 &lt; 1\\), so \\(1-\\delta &lt; f(x) &lt; 1\\).\nIf \\(0 &lt; x &lt; \\delta\\), then \\(0 &lt; x^2 &lt; \\delta^2\\), so \\(0 &lt; f(x) &lt; \\delta^2\\).\nIf \\(x=0\\), \\(f(x) = 0\\)\n\nSo the right half of our neighbourhood of 0 is near \\(f(0)\\), but if \\(\\delta &lt; 1\\), then the left half is not near \\(f(0)\\), it’s near 1. We have a jump discontinuity.\nNotice how this example reverses the logic of our definition of continuity. The definition states that every neighbourhood of \\(f(a)\\) contains an image of some neighbourhood of \\(a\\). Thus to show a function is continuous we first specify an arbitrary tolerance for how close the function should be to \\(f(a)\\) and then check how close points must be to \\(a\\) to ensure they land close to \\(f(a)\\). Since our function \\(f\\) in this example splits neighbourhoods of 0 into two pieces, one near 0 and one near 1, it can’t satisfy the requirements of the definition.\n\nExample 3.2 Consider the (piecewise) function \\(f\\) defined by \\[f(x) = \\begin{cases}\nx+1 & -1 \\le x &lt; 0 \\\\\n1-x^2 & 0 \\le x \\le 1\n\\end{cases}\\]\nDoes \\(f\\) have a discontinuity at \\(0\\)?\n\nSince the left side of the function has the same definition, we just need to look at what \\(f\\) does to the right half of a neighbourhood of \\(0\\).\n\nIf \\(0 &lt; x &lt; \\delta\\), then \\(1 &lt; 1-x^2 &lt; 1-\\delta^2\\), so \\(1 &lt; f(x) &lt; 1-\\delta^2\\).\n\nFor this example, \\(f(0) = 1\\) and the image of a neighbourhood of 0 stays in a neighbourhood of \\(f(0)\\). Hence \\(f\\) is continuous at 0.",

    "text": "4.3 The Product and Quotient Rules\nOne way to help remember the product rule is to consider a rectangle with sides of length \\(f\\) and \\(g\\). The area of this rectangle is the product \\(fg\\). If we change the length of the second side by a small amount, say from \\(g\\) to \\(g+dg\\), then the area changes from \\(fg\\) to \\(f(g+dg)\\). That’s a change of \\(f\\,dg\\). If we change the length of the first side, the change in the area is \\(df\\, g\\). Adding these two together gives us something that looks like the product rule: \\(df\\,g + f\\,dg\\). The details of how these calculations look using limits are given in the text.\n\nExample 4.1 Differentiate \\(x \\log x\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( x \\log x \\right) &= \\log(x) + x\\frac{d}{dx} \\log x \\\\\n                                     &= \\log(x) + x\\frac{1}{x} \\\\\n                                     &= 1 + \\log(x) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.2 Differentiate \\(x e^x\\sin x\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe apply the product rule twice. The order doesn’t matter.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( x e^x\\sin x \\right)\n&= \\left(\\frac{d}{dx} xe^x\\right)\\sin x  + xe^x\\frac{d}{dx}\\sin x \\\\\n&= \\left(e^x  + xe^x\\right)\\sin x + xe^x\\cos x \\\\\n&= \\left(1+x)\\right)e^x\\sin x + xe^x\\cos x\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nThe origin of the quotient rule doesn’t have as simple a geometric motivation as the product rule, but it can be easily derived from the product rule. First, start by naming the ratio \\(F\\) \\[F(x) = \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\] Then rewrite this as a product \\[F(x)g(x) = f(x)\\] Now differentiate both sides of the equality. \\[F'(x)g(x) + F(x)g'(x) = f'(x)\\] Replace \\(F\\) by the ratio \\[F'(x)g(x) + \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}g'(x) = f'(x)\\] and isolate \\(F'\\) on the left side \\[F'(x) = \\frac{f'(x)}{g(x)} - \\frac{f(x)g'(x)}{(g(x))^2}\\]\n\nExample 4.3 Find the derivative of \\(\\tan x\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\tan x\n&= \\frac{d}{dx} \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} \\\\\n&= \\frac{ \\left(\\frac{d}{dx} \\sin x \\right) \\cos x - \\sin x \\frac{d}{dx} \\cos x  }{(\\cos x)^2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{ \\cos x \\cos x - (\\sin x)(-\\sin x)  }{(\\cos x)^2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{ (\\cos x)^2  + (\\sin x)^2  }{(\\cos x)^2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{(\\cos x)^2} \\\\\n&= (\\sec x)^2\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe can also write this as \\(1 + (\\tan x)^2\\)\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.4 Where does \\(x\\mapsto \\dfrac{3x}{4 + x^2}\\) have a horizontal tangent?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’re being asked to find where the derivative of \\(\\dfrac{3x}{4 + x^2}\\) is zero. Use the quotient rule to find the derivative.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\dfrac{3x}{4 + x^2}\n&= \\frac{ (3)(4+x^2) - (3x)(0+2x) }{(4+x^2)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{ 12 - 3x^2 }{(4+x^2)}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe denominator is always positive (no vertical tangent lines) and the numerator is zero when \\(x\\) is either 2 or -2.",
